    "# 03 - XGBoost Model: Predicting Global Radiation (glorad)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective  \n",
    "This notebook trains an XGBoost regression model to predict daily global radiation (glorad) using available weather features: rainfall, maximum temperature (maxtp), and minimum temperature (mintp).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The model aims to serve as the first stage of a two-stage forecasting pipeline, providing an estimated radiation value that can be used to predict daily solar energy generation in the next stage.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach addresses a key challenge in the Irish context — the unavailability of glorad forecasts — by attempting to model glorad from weather features that are available both historically and as forecasts.\n"
